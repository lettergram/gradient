gradient
========

Draws lines between high gradience in the red color channel of RGB.

This can be used to find lines, for example, straight lines rarely appear in nature,
further purple (and red) is the rarest color found in nature.

If you could therefore search an image and find straight lines which are purple (or red),
you could say it is "likely" that an object is man made.
